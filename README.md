# Dusty Data Detectives
Welcome to the world's nerdiest detective agency! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Here, we investigate dusty air, decode pollution data, and fight invisible enemies like PM2.5 using the power of Python. Expect clean code, dirty air, and lots of well-labeled graphs (coming soon).

## Why this repo exists
This project is part of an environmental coding assignment that explores air quality monitoring using simple Python scripts. It‚Äôs hands-on, humorous, and maybe a little dramatic.
